//probably we can't hook overall app to store but the nested containers
//since App is exported to index for rendering
//and this serves as the store part of redux and react redux without
//dealing with any paticular data / only nesting integration of components and creation of store

//Provider connects (linker library) created redux store that integrates all pieces of state4
//To our react app. 
//Our state is created by the unification of all the pieces of state (reducers)
//Never mutate state but whole complete recreation each type triggered by the
//Direction of our actions
